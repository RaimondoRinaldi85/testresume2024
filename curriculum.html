            <p>
                Shortly after I started college, I had to put my education on hold and return home to work and help my
                family. My first job was as an electrician’s assistant for an independent company that worked with
                generator motors and building implants. I assisted with soldering and assembling electrical implants.
                <br><br>

                My next job was working for a service group as a freelance waiter and bartender. It was during this time
                that I trained and acquired my strong social skills, while gaining valuable experience communicating in
                English, French, Spanish, German as well as my native language of Italian.<br><br>

                While working as a bartender and a waiter I was also working as a chemistry lab technician for
                Legambiente. Legambiente is a company that promotes and enhances a wide variety of production actions
                with the goal of improving the quality of the environment. My responsibilities as a chemistry lab
                technician were to analyze water and food to find any trace of harmful substances. All that I had
                learned with my Chemistry Technician Diploma was put into action during my time at Legambiente.<br><br>

                In 2014 I started working for M3XP, which is a hardware laboratory in Sarno, Italy. I managed to accrue
                three years of work experience in the IT field working for this hardware and software company. I had the
                privilege of working for SawSystems in their Hardware Laboratory as its chief, where I learned valuable
                professional skills such as soldering, installing and troubleshooting hardware and software for clients.
                In the meantime, I was also a freelance bilingual technician for companies and businesses and I was a
                private IT.<br><br>

                In 2017 I attended three conventions for a SawSystems’ Start-up in Bologna, Berlin, and Milan where I
                spoke in Italian and English with potential financial lenders for the company’s team. I also had the job
                of translating the app and the app’s brochure from Italian to English for the Berlin convention. Through
                the years I have been a translator for businesses, acquaintances, and friends translating simultaneously
                between spoken and written Italian and English.<br><br>

                Working as a bilingual IT for the past five years has developed my troubleshooting skills by working
                with a variety of hardware and software for my clients. I have gained experience with installation and
                the use of software for accountants, lawyers, and factories. I have developed my knowledge of setting
                up, organizing, installing, and troubleshooting servers mounting Microsoft software, Mac, and Linux
                Server distros operating systems. I have much experience setting up, organizing, and installing LAN
                connections, routers/modems as well as troubleshooting connections problems. As an IT, I have the
                opportunity to travel to clients’ place of business to make repairs, or assist clients remotely in
                addition to providing tips and helping customers when they need to buy new hardware. I have created
                several websites for clients using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SASS. I also have experience with
                BootStrap 4, VueJS, and React frameworks.
